# Neko E-com: A Vanilla JavaScript E-commerce Frontend

## About

Neko E-com is a clean, responsive, and fully functional e-commerce landing page built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The core functionalities are handled client-side, making it lightweight and easy to understand.

## Key Features:

- **Dynamic Product Rendering:** Products are loaded from a JavaScript array and dynamically rendered onto the page, making the product list easily scalable.

- **Interactive Shopping Cart:** Users can add items to a shopping cart, which updates the total price in real-time.

- **Cart Management:** Items can be removed from the cart, and the UI reflects these changes instantly.

- **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using modern CSS Flexbox and Media Queries.

- **Zero Dependencies:** The entire project is self-contained and runs without any external libraries like jQuery, React, or Vue.

- **Simulated Forms:** A functional contact form that captures user input and simulates a submission.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the structure and semantics of the webpage.

- **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, and responsiveness.

- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all interactivity and logic.
